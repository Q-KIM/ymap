Branch: Fix__Chromosome-end-bias_large-chr-effect

The chr-end bias correction code introduces an error in condition where larger chromosomes have increased copy number.
The LOWESS normalization curve removes true increase in copy number found at the center of large chromosomes, because there is no smaller chromosome data to balance it.
Two methods of fixing:
	1) Normalization is only from the end of the chromosomes to the half-width of smallest chromosome.
	2) Data used for normalization is extended for smaller chromosomes to half-width of largest chromosome, using median value of data from middle of each chr.
