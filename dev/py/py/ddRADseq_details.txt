CNV analysis of ddRADseq datasets:
----------------------------------

Simulated digest of reference genome
    The Candida albicans reference SC5314 genome assembly (ver. A21-s02-m08-r09) was computational digested by the target sites
    for the restriction enzymes used in the library preparation (MfeI, [C:AATTG]; MboI, [:GATC]).   The resulting genome fragments
    which were edged by cut sites for both restriction enzymes were considered usable.   The length and GC-bias of all usable
	fragments was calculated.

Processing raw sequencing data
	Reads for the reference control and experimental datasets were aligned to the Candida albicans SC5314 reference genome
	(A21-s02-m08-r09[***ask Gareth***]) using BWA/Bowtie2[**ask Gareth***] using standard settings [***ask Gareth***].   A pileup
	file containing the number of reads at every genome coordinate was generated using Samtools.   The average read depth was
	calculated for each usable simulated restriction fragment.

Correction of dataset-specific biases
	A LOWESS fitting of average read depth vs. length of usable simulated restriction fragments was performed separately for the
	control and experimental datasets.   The average read depths were normalized by dividing by the resulting fit curve.   Any
	fragments where the LOWESS fit curve fell below one were considered unusable because of the reduced dynamic range.  Any
	fragments shorter than 50 bp or longer than 1000 bp were discarded because of the increased variation in average read depth for
	those fragments.   This corrected for dataset-specific biases introduced by the length-dependent degradation of restriction
	fragments.

	A LOWESS fitting of corrected read depth vs. GC-bias of remaining usable simulated restriction fragments was performed separately
	for the control and experimental datasets.   The corrected read depths were normalized again by dividing by the resulting fit
	curve.   This corrected for dataset-specific GC-biases introduced during PCR amplification.

Correction for coordinate-specific biases
	The corrected read depth for the experimental dataset for each usable simulated restriction fragment was divided by the corrected
	read depth for the control dataset.   This corrected for uncharacterized location-specific biases.

Display of final CNV estimates
	A final histogram of CNV estimates was made by calculating the weighted average of the corrected read depths for each usable
	restriction fragment found to cover a portion of each histogram bin.   These CNV estimates were multiplied by the whole genome
	estimate determined via flow cytometry and then plotted on a linear scale, with black bars extending from the expected euploid
	copy number to the determined copy number for each genomic region.

Molecular karyotyping by RAD-seq coverage
-----------------------------------------

	Processing raw sequencing data

For each lane of sequencing, the raw reads were separated into bins based on their 4-base strain- specific barcode (5’ end of each read).
Within each strain-specific bin the barcodes were removed and reads were then aligned to the S288c reference genome sequence
(SGD R64-1-1_20110203) using BWA (v0.5.8) (5) with up to 6 mismatches allowed. The 5’ start positions of all reads with a Phred-scaled
mapping alignment quality of at least 20 were counted, resulting in a set of marker positions for each strain along with the number of
reads aligning to each of those positions.

	Marker selection

Next, a series of filtering steps were performed to select an optimal set of markers to represent the DNA copy number across the genome.
First, markers with a median of 0 or 1 counts over all strains sequenced for this study (~400) were removed. We believe that the majority
of these markers represent sequencing or DNA fragmentation errors. Second, the consistency of the markers was compared to the expected
length of the MfeI-MboI DNA fragment, based on the S288c reference sequence, i.e. each marker should represent a set of reads directed to
the MfeI end of a unique MfeI-MboI restriction fragment.

	For each marker within each strain, the proportion of all reads aligning to that marker was then calculated, as follows:

[Figure 1]

The consistency of each marker was then expressed as the Coefficient of Variance (CV) of those proportions across all strains and plotted
against the predicted marker fragment length (Fig. S10).

As can be seen from the figure, the CV of markers arising from fragments well within the expected gel-selected size range (~75-425 bp) is
low, but rises rapidly outside this range. In addition, a small number of markers within the selected size range still have inconsistent
behavior (high CV). We therefore decided to set 2 filters, 125bp <= Marker fragment length <= 400bp, and Marker CV <= 0.6, to select for
markers that we believe should behave in a reliable manner.

[Figure 2]

This reduces the markers available for the subsequent analysis by about 30%, but still leaves more than 3000 markers spanning the genome.

	Individual strain calculations relative to the euploid reference panel

To normalize marker-specific coverage effects, a reference euploid panel (R.E.P.) of 13 sequenced strains was selected. For each marker in
each query strain the read coverage (proportion) was normalized using the mean read coverage (proportion) from this panel. Assessment of
the copy number of each chromosome in each query strain was then carried out as follows. First, for each marker in the length and CV filtered
set, the proportion of all reads aligning to the marker was calculated and then normalized by dividing by the mean marker proportion from
the reference euploid panel:

[Figure 3]

As this ratio will vary slightly depending on ploidy (aneuploids versus euploids or other aneuploids), it was then normalized to set the
median marker ratio to 1:

[Figure 4]

The resulting normalized marker ratios were then plotted on a log2 scale against the marker number, ordered according to the genomic position,
using the R statistical software environment (http://www.r-project.org/). Each point represents a marker, and chromosomes are given alternating
colors. To keep a constant scale, the y-axis was limited from the values of -1 to 2. The ratios of an extremely small number of markers lie
outside this range, but do not affect the interpretation of the figures. These plots, in conjunction with flow cytometry analysis, were then
used to assess the number of copies of each chromosome in each strain.
